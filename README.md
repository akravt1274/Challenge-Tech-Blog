# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge: Tech Blog

## Description
In this challenge, I built a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, the bcrypt package to hash passwords, and the express-session and connect-session-sequelize npm packages for authentication.
